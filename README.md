# MediaKeyMap

Standard Keyboard mostly doesnâ€™t come with dedicated media buttons. Not all keyboards have media keys but you can fix this issue. I use standard 104 keys for my daily use, it has no Fn key and no media control keys such as volume +, volume -, play/pause, next / prev. So I created a small hotkey program to solve that issue. ðŸ™‚

So I mapped these key combinations:

Windows key + F6 : Media_Prev

Windows key + F7 : Media_Play_Pause

Windows key + F8 : Media_Next

Windows key + F4 :Volume_Mute

Windows key + F2 : Volume_Down

Windows key + F3 : Volume_Up


How to use

1. Download Media KeyMap

2. Unzip it

3. Move it to C:\Program Files folder and run

4. Press the Windows key + R to open the run dialog box.

5. Type shell:startup in the run dialog box and press Enter on your keyboard.

6. Right click in the startup folder and click New.

7. Click Shortcut.

8. Browse to locate the Media KeyMap.exe program on your computer.

9. Click Next.

10. Click Finish.

Done. ðŸ™‚
