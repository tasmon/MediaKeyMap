# MediaKeyMap
Standard Keyboard mostly doesnâ€™t come with dedicated media buttons. Not all keyboards have media keys but you can fix this issue. I use standard 104 keys for my daily use, it has no Fn key and no media control keys such as volume +, volume -, play/pause, next / prev. So I created a small hotkey program to solve that issue. ðŸ™‚

So I mapped these key combinations:
Windows key + F6 : Media_Prev
Windows key + F7 : Media_Play_Pause
Windows key + F8 : Media_Next
Windows key + F4 :Volume_Mute
Windows key + F2 : Volume_Down
Windows key + F3 : Volume_Up
